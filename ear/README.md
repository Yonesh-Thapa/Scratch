# EarModule (Digital Ear)

Listens to real audio samples (pronunciations of symbols).
Extracts real audio features (MFCCs, spectrograms) using open-source libraries.
Can also “listen” to audio generated by MouthModule.
Learns audio-symbol associations and can compare similarity for feedback.
Runs as an independent process, communicates via sockets/IPC.

## Overview
The EarModule listens to real audio samples, extracts MFCC features using librosa, and learns audio-symbol associations using the Delta Rule. It runs independently and communicates with other modules via sockets (no function calls or global state).

## Features
- Listens to real audio samples (A, B, C, 1, 2, 3)
- Extracts MFCC features (n_mfcc=13, sample rate=16kHz)
- Learns audio-symbol associations with real, updatable parameters
- Runs as a standalone process

## Usage
Run the module independently:
```bash
python ear_module.py --lr 0.01
```

## Communication Protocol
- Listens on TCP port 5003
- Accepts commands:
  - `recognize`: Given MFCC features, returns the recognized symbol
  - `learn`: Given MFCC features and target symbol, updates parameters using the Delta Rule

## Energy Efficiency & Minimal Data Retention
- Only stores compressed parameters (no raw audio)
- All computation is optimized for minimal resource use

## Path of Least Action
- All learning and recognition is performed in the most direct, efficient way possible
